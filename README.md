# Cognition

**AI-Powered, Employee-Centered Retail Training Platform**

Cognition is an interactive Learning Management System (LMS) designed to improve retail onboarding by focusing on real-world skill transfer, employee confidence, and situational readiness. Built as a **Senior Design I** project at **The City College of New York**, Cognition rethinks traditional compliance-driven training by centering the employee experience, especially for **young, first-time, and neurodivergent workers**.

## 📌 Overview

Retail organizations invest heavily in training, yet many onboarding systems fail to prepare employees for real customer interactions, emergency situations, and store-specific workflows. Cognition addresses this gap by combining AI-powered simulations, map-based training, and behavior-based analytics to create a more effective onboarding experience for both employees and employers.

## 🎯 Goals

- Improve training transfer from onboarding to real retail environments  
- Increase employee confidence and preparedness  
- Reduce disengagement and early turnover  
- Provide employers with actionable, behavior-based training insights
